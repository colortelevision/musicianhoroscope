            <strong>MOON ALERT:</strong> The Moon in Capricorn shifts toward Aquarius later today, moving from rigid clock-syncing to experimental voltage-controlled chaos. Avoid signing major distribution deals or buying 'as-is' vintage synths until the lunar jitter settles this evening.
        </div>
        
        <div class="grid">
            
        <div class="row">
            <div class="sign"><h3>Aries</h3><p>Your creative transients are peaking in the red today, but the saturation sounds surprisingly musical. Channel that aggressive energy into a high-bpm hardware jam rather than a heated debate over DAW preference in the comments section.</p></div>
            <div class="sign"><h3>Taurus</h3><p>You're feeling the pull of high-end wood-cheeked hardware and premium cable management. Don't settle for a digital emulation of your goals; invest in the 'analog warmth' of a slow, tactile project that requires actual knobs and faders.</p></div>
        </div>
        
        <div class="row">
            <div class="sign"><h3>Gemini</h3><p>Your brain is operating like a dual-oscillator system with a failing LFO, causing some beautiful but distracting frequency modulation. Find a collaborator who can act as your master clock to keep your many ideas from drifting out of phase.</p></div>
            <div class="sign"><h3>Cancer</h3><p>The studio is your sanctuary today, and the vibe is strictly '100% wet reverb.' It’s a perfect day for tracking intimate, lo-fi vocals, but make sure you don't let a minor technical glitch dampen your emotional resonance.</p></div>
        </div>
        
        <div class="row">
            <div class="sign"><h3>Leo</h3><p>The spotlight is hitting your gold-plated patch cables just right. You have the stage presence of a legendary front-man today, so don't be afraid to push your lead synth to the front of the mix and let it breathe.</p></div>
            <div class="sign"><h3>Virgo</h3><p>You are a human parametric EQ today, carving out space and removing the mud from every situation. Use this precision to organize your sample libraries or finally fix that ground hum that's been haunting your signal chain.</p></div>
        </div>
        
        <div class="row">
            <div class="sign"><h3>Libra</h3><p>Harmony is your primary directive, but watch out for 'phase cancellation' in your social circles. Seek a balanced stereo image between your professional ambitions and your need for a quiet, low-pass-filtered evening.</p></div>
            <div class="sign"><h3>Scorpio</h3><p>There’s a deep, sub-bass mystery to your energy today that others find both intimidating and magnetic. Keep your secret production techniques 'under the hood' for now; some patches are most effective when they aren't fully understood.</p></div>
        </div>
        
        <div class="row">
            <div class="sign"><h3>Sagittarius</h3><p>Your creative vision is panning wide, eyeing international tour dates or complex modular expansions. It’s a great day for 'blue sky' thinking, provided you don't forget to pack your adapters and power supplies for the journey.</p></div>
            <div class="sign"><h3>Capricorn</h3><p>With the moon finishing its transit through your sign, you are the backbone of the arrangement. Your discipline is the steady 4/4 kick drum that everyone else is syncing to, so stay grounded and keep the tempo consistent.</p></div>
        </div>
        
        <div class="row">
            <div class="sign"><h3>Aquarius</h3><p>The Sun in your sign is triggering some truly generative, 'happy accidents' in your workflow. Lean into the glitch and the unpredictable patches; the most compelling art you make today will come from breaking the traditional rules of music theory.</p></div>
            <div class="sign"><h3>Pisces</h3><p>You’re drifting through a beautiful, tape-saturated haze today where the line between your dreams and your demos is blurred. This is prime time for ambient composition, just ensure you're actually hitting 'record' before you get lost in the clouds.</p></div>

            <strong>IF YOUR BIRTHDAY IS TODAY:</strong> Happy Solar Return! Your upcoming year is characterized by high headroom and low latency. Expect a major breakthrough in your signature sound as you balance vintage soul with futuristic synthesis; may your signal always be clear and your resonance always be peaked.
