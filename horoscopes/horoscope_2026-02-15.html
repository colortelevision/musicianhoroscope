            <strong>MOON ALERT:</strong> The moon drifts into a hazy, bit-crushed transit today, encouraging a departure from the grid. Expect unexpected feedback loops in your interpersonal signal path; keep your limiters engaged to avoid emotional clipping.
        </div>
        
        <div class="grid">
            
        <div class="row">
            <div class="sign"><h3>Aries</h3><p>Your creative drive is hitting the red today, but that saturation sounds intentional. Don't waste time on a meticulous soundcheck; capture that first-take energy before the inspiration loses its transients.</p></div>
            <div class="sign"><h3>Taurus</h3><p>Stability is your sonic signature today, much like a perfectly calibrated VCO that never drifts. It’s a great afternoon for committing your MIDI to audio—stop tweaking the filter and let the texture breathe in the real world.</p></div>
        </div>
        
        <div class="row">
            <div class="sign"><h3>Gemini</h3><p>Your workflow is feeling multi-timbral, but watch out for phase cancellation in your social life. Use this dual-core energy to bridge the gap between a dusty hardware jam and a polished digital arrangement.</p></div>
            <div class="sign"><h3>Cancer</h3><p>The room acoustics of your heart are feeling a bit reflective today, perfect for dialing in long, cinematic reverb tails. Stay in the home studio and focus on the felt-piano melodies that keep you grounded.</p></div>
        </div>
        
        <div class="row">
            <div class="sign"><h3>Leo</h3><p>You’re the center frequency everyone is tuning to today, so make sure your output is clear of unwanted hiss. It’s time to step out of the sidechain and take the lead melody—the spotlight loves your natural resonance.</p></div>
            <div class="sign"><h3>Virgo</h3><p>Today is perfect for deep-cleaning your patch bay and reorganizing your sample library by mood rather than genre. A precise EQ cut in your schedule will reveal the hidden harmonics of a project you previously thought was finished.</p></div>
        </div>
        
        <div class="row">
            <div class="sign"><h3>Libra</h3><p>Balance your stereo field by collaborating with someone whose aesthetic complements your own. If your mix feels cluttered, try panning your distractions hard left and right to make room for your primary creative goal.</p></div>
            <div class="sign"><h3>Scorpio</h3><p>There is a deep, subsonic power in your creative secrecy right now; keep your best patches under wraps. Dig into the dark textures of a wavetable synth to find the tension your bridge has been missing.</p></div>
        </div>
        
        <div class="row">
            <div class="sign"><h3>Sagittarius</h3><p>You’re craving a sonic adventure that exceeds your current CPU capacity. Look for inspiration outside the box—literally—by taking a field recorder into the wild and capturing the organic rhythm of the world.</p></div>
            <div class="sign"><h3>Capricorn</h3><p>Your discipline is the master clock that keeps the whole production in sync. While others are lost in a feedback loop of indecision, your commitment to the fundamental bassline will ensure the track actually gets finished.</p></div>
        </div>
        
        <div class="row">
            <div class="sign"><h3>Aquarius</h3><p>The stars are routing your signal through a series of glitchy, experimental modules today. Embrace the happy accidents and the 'wrong' notes, as they contain the secret sauce for your next avant-garde masterpiece.</p></div>
            <div class="sign"><h3>Pisces</h3><p>You are swimming in a sea of delay trails and ethereal pads today, making it hard to find the beat. Trust your intuition to act as a low-pass filter, cutting out the noise so your most soulful frequencies can shine through.</p></div>
        </div>
        
        </div>

        <div class="birthday">
            <strong>IF YOUR BIRTHDAY IS TODAY:</strong> This year, your life enters a lush, polyphonic phase where multiple creative dreams finally sync up. May your signal-to-noise ratio stay high and your vintage gear never require an emergency technician.
