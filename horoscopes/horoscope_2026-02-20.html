            <strong>MOON ALERT:</strong> The Moon in Aries creates a high-gain environment where impulses hit the red line quickly. Monitor your internal levels and avoid making permanent edits to your master track while emotions are clipping.
        </div>
        
        <div class="grid">
            
        <div class="row">
            <div class="sign"><h3>Aries</h3><p>Your creative signal is running through a hot preamp today, bringing plenty of natural saturation to your projects. Harness this drive to finish that high-energy sequence, but be wary of burning out your tubes before the session ends.</p></div>
            <div class="sign"><h3>Taurus</h3><p>Focus on the tactile response of your hardware today; there is magic in the physical resistance of a well-weighted key. It’s a grounding day for recalibrating your analog oscillators and ensuring your studio’s foundation is phase-coherent.</p></div>
        </div>
        
        <div class="row">
            <div class="sign"><h3>Gemini</h3><p>Your brain is operating like a dual-engine processor, making it the perfect time for complex routing and stereo-link experiments. Communication with bandmates is effortless, as long as you don't let the conversation devolve into a debate over sample rates.</p></div>
            <div class="sign"><h3>Cancer</h3><p>The vibes are deep and resonant, much like a vintage ribbon mic in a wooden room. Retreat into your home studio sanctuary to capture those intimate, lo-fi vocal takes that only emerge when the world is quiet.</p></div>
        </div>
        
        <div class="row">
            <div class="sign"><h3>Leo</h3><p>The spotlight is hitting your center frequencies with undeniable warmth. Whether you're performing live or just sharing a clip on the grid, your presence has the unmistakable character of a gold-sputtered condenser mic.</p></div>
            <div class="sign"><h3>Virgo</h3><p>It’s a day for surgical EQ and meticulous cable management. Cleaning up the noise floor in your life and your DAW will reveal the subtle harmonics you’ve been missing in your latest compositions.</p></div>
        </div>
        
        <div class="row">
            <div class="sign"><h3>Libra</h3><p>You are seeking the perfect wet/dry balance in your collaborations. Focus on finding the harmonic midpoint between your artistic vision and the technical constraints of your current gear setup.</p></div>
            <div class="sign"><h3>Scorpio</h3><p>Deep, granular synthesis and dark, minor-key modulations are your best friends today. Dig into the sub-bass of your psyche to find the hidden melodies that live beneath the surface of a standard arrangement.</p></div>
        </div>
        
        <div class="row">
            <div class="sign"><h3>Sagittarius</h3><p>Your sonic horizons are expanding, making it a great day to book a tour or experiment with world-scale tunings. Don't be afraid to venture outside the box; your creative signal needs some room to breathe and reflect.</p></div>
            <div class="sign"><h3>Capricorn</h3><p>Discipline is your master clock today, keeping every element of your career in perfect sync. Apply that legendary work ethic to the business side of music—send those invoices and update your EPK with high-fidelity precision.</p></div>
        </div>
        
        <div class="row">
            <div class="sign"><h3>Aquarius</h3><p>The unconventional patch points in your life are finally starting to make sense. Embrace the beautiful glitches and accidental feedback loops that occur when you stop trying to follow the traditional manual.</p></div>
            <div class="sign"><h3>Pisces</h3><p>The Sun in your sign amplifies your natural reverb, making everything feel ethereal and cinematic. Trust your intuition to guide your hand across the faders; the mix will settle exactly where it’s meant to be.</p></div>

            <strong>IF YOUR BIRTHDAY IS TODAY:</strong> You are a rare, limited-run boutique synth with a sound that can't be replicated by any plugin. This year, your creative output moves from the experimental demo phase into a polished, full-length production with high-fidelity resonance.
