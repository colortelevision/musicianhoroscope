            <strong>MOON ALERT:</strong> The Moon drifts through the ethereal fog of Pisces, squaring the nodes. It’s a day for deep-seated reverb tails and trusting your ears over your analyzers; just be wary of 'vibe' replacing actual signal flow.
        </div>
        
        <div class="grid">
            
        <div class="row">
            <div class="sign"><h3>Aries</h3><p>Your creative drive is running through a high-gain preamp today, but watch for clipping in your personal relationships. Don't over-compress your ideas just to fit a trend; let the transients breathe. A chance encounter in a gear forum leads to a surprising melody.</p></div>
            <div class="sign"><h3>Taurus</h3><p>Your workflow feels like a dusty vintage synth—reliable once it warms up, but prone to drifting out of tune. Resist the urge to buy new modules and instead re-patch what you already own. There is hidden polyphony in your oldest sketches.</p></div>
        </div>
        
        <div class="row">
            <div class="sign"><h3>Gemini</h3><p>You’re juggling too many tracks in the arrangement, and your CPU is starting to spike. Freeze your side projects and focus on the lead vocal of your life. A conversation with a bassist brings a much-needed grounding frequency to your erratic week.</p></div>
            <div class="sign"><h3>Cancer</h3><p>The emotional resonance is high, making it a perfect day for tracking ambient pads and soulful solos. Your intuition is acting like a perfect low-pass filter, cutting out the noise and leaving only the warmth. Don't be afraid to let the tape hiss show your vulnerability.</p></div>
        </div>
        
        <div class="row">
            <div class="sign"><h3>Leo</h3><p>The spotlight is hitting your patchbay, but the routing is complex today. You have the charisma of a stadium headliner, but make sure your monitors are balanced before you make any big technical demands. True power comes from the subtle saturation, not the loudest volume.</p></div>
            <div class="sign"><h3>Virgo</h3><p>You're tempted to quantize every aspect of your day to a 16th-note grid, but the beauty lies in the swing. Allow for some human error in your schedule to catch a 'happy accident' in the studio. Perfection is a sterile mix; character is found in the offset.</p></div>
        </div>
        
        <div class="row">
            <div class="sign"><h3>Libra</h3><p>Collaboration is your strongest plugin today, provided you keep the phase alignment in check. Balance your desire for aesthetic gear with the practical need for a finished master. A bridge you wrote months ago finally finds its chorus.</p></div>
            <div class="sign"><h3>Scorpio</h3><p>You're diving deep into the sub-frequencies of your psyche, uncovering dark textures that demand to be heard. Don't be afraid of the dissonance; it’s the tension that makes the resolution feel earned. Your magnetic field is attracting a high-profile creative partner.</p></div>
        </div>
        
        <div class="row">
            <div class="sign"><h3>Sagittarius</h3><p>The road is calling, even if you're just sitting in your bedroom studio. Break out of your usual scales and experiment with a microtonal approach to your problems. A sudden shift in your monitoring environment reveals a truth you've been masking with EQ.</p></div>
            <div class="sign"><h3>Capricorn</h3><p>Your career path is looking like a well-organized rack unit, but don't forget to plug in the patch cables. Structure is useless without the flow of creative electricity. Invest in your long-term setup rather than chasing a quick digital fix.</p></div>
        </div>
        
        <div class="row">
            <div class="sign"><h3>Aquarius</h3><p>As the Sun prepares to exit your sign, your experimental ideas are finally reaching their peak resonance. You are the master clock of your own unconventional universe; don't let anyone tell you your signal is 'too weird.' The niche is where you thrive.</p></div>
            <div class="sign"><h3>Pisces</h3><p>The floodgates of inspiration are wide open as the Sun enters your sign, creating a lush, wet-mix reality. Everything feels like a first take today, so keep the 'record' button armed at all times. You are the source of the melody that everyone else is trying to sample.</p></div>

        <div class="birthday">
            <strong>IF YOUR BIRTHDAY IS TODAY:</strong> This year is a high-fidelity remaster of your greatest hits with bonus tracks you haven't even written yet. Expect your dynamic range to expand significantly as you find the perfect balance between DIY grit and professional polish. Your internal metronome is finally in sync with the universe.
