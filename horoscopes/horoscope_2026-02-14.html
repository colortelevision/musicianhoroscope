            <strong>MOON ALERT:</strong> The Moon moves through a high-fidelity transit today, urging you to check your gain staging before committing to a take. It’s a day for warm saturation and deep connections, so keep your signal path clear of unwanted noise.
        </div>
        
        <div class="grid">
            
        <div class="row">
            <div class="sign"><h3>Aries</h3><p>You're pushing the preamp into the red today, but that harmonic distortion actually sounds sweet. Don't overthink the headroom; just capture the performance while the energy is still peak-level and raw.</p></div>
            <div class="sign"><h3>Taurus</h3><p>Your creative workflow feels like a vintage tube amp—slow to warm up, but once it’s glowing, the tone is irreplaceable. Avoid the urge to buy new gear today; instead, rediscover the hidden 'Easter eggs' in the synth you already own.</p></div>
        </div>
        
        <div class="row">
            <div class="sign"><h3>Gemini</h3><p>You’re running in dual-mono today, trying to balance two different creative identities at once. If your focus starts to phase out, use a hard-wired clock source to sync your intentions and keep the rhythm tight.</p></div>
            <div class="sign"><h3>Cancer</h3><p>The studio is your shell, but don't let the acoustic treatment muffle your intuition. Allow some room reverb into your life today; sometimes the most beautiful moments are the ones that bleed into the other tracks.</p></div>
        </div>
        
        <div class="row">
            <div class="sign"><h3>Leo</h3><p>The spotlight is hitting your faceplate just right, and your presence is cutting through the densest mix. Even if you’re just tweaking filters in your bedroom, carry yourself with the confidence of a headliner at a sold-out modular synth fest.</p></div>
            <div class="sign"><h3>Virgo</h3><p>You’re spending way too much time nudging transients to the grid. Let the track breathe—the 'humanize' function is your friend today, and a little bit of drift is what makes the sequence feel alive.</p></div>
        </div>
        
        <div class="row">
            <div class="sign"><h3>Libra</h3><p>It’s a day to check the phase correlation of your personal relationships. If the vibe feels thin or hollow, try flipping the polarity and see if the low-end warmth returns to your social circle.</p></div>
            <div class="sign"><h3>Scorpio</h3><p>You’re diving deep into the sub-frequencies of your psyche where the real heavy-hitters live. Keep your proprietary patches secret for now, but don’t be afraid to let a little bit of that dark, analog grit leak out into your art.</p></div>
        </div>
        
        <div class="row">
            <div class="sign"><h3>Sagittarius</h3><p>Your sonic horizons are expanding like an infinite shimmer reverb. Don't get so lost in the 100% wet mix that you lose your dry signal; stay grounded while you explore these new, ethereal territories.</p></div>
            <div class="sign"><h3>Capricorn</h3><p>You are the master of the master fader today, keeping everything strictly within the limits of the project. Your discipline is admirable, but don't be afraid to bypass the limiter occasionally to see how much dynamic range you truly have.</p></div>
        </div>
        
        <div class="row">
            <div class="sign"><h3>Aquarius</h3><p>Your signal chain is looking delightfully unconventional, and the glitches you're producing are actually features, not bugs. Route your heart through a granular sampler and see what beautiful, fragmented textures emerge from the chaos.</p></div>
            <div class="sign"><h3>Pisces</h3><p>You’re drifting through a sea of tape delay and soft-synth pads, feeling every frequency. Trust your ears over your spectrum analyzer today—if the emotional resonance is there, the technical specs don't mean a thing.</p></div>
        </div>
        
        </div>

        <div class="birthday">
            <strong>IF YOUR BIRTHDAY IS TODAY:</strong> Happy Birthday! May this year be your definitive LP—full of rich textures, no filler tracks, and a production value that stands the test of time. May your cables never fray and your favorite VST never crash.
