        <div class="moon-alert">
            <strong>MOON ALERT:</strong> The Moon moves into a square with Uranus, creating unexpected pitch-drift in your daily routine. Keep your firmware updated and your oscillators warmed up for at least twenty minutes before attempting any critical takes.
        </div>
        
        <div class="grid">
            
        <div class="row">
            <div class="sign"><h3>Aries</h3><p>Your internal clock is running at 140 BPM while the rest of the world is stuck in a slow-core ambient set. Don't force the tempo; instead, use that high-frequency energy to tackle the cable management project you've been avoiding.</p></div>
            <div class="sign"><h3>Taurus</h3><p>The urge to buy another boutique synth is masking a need for structural arrangement. Ground your signal chain today and find the hidden resonance in the gear you already own before chasing a new shiny faceplate.</p></div>
        </div>
        
        <div class="row">
            <div class="sign"><h3>Gemini</h3><p>You’re tracking ideas in a house of mirrors, hearing harmonies that haven't even been written yet. It’s a dual-mono kind of day—keep your experimental side and your professional side on separate channels so they don't phase-cancel each other out.</p></div>
            <div class="sign"><h3>Cancer</h3><p>Your emotional preamp is running hot, adding a pleasant harmonic distortion to your creative collaborations. Use this natural warmth to bridge the gap between a cold MIDI sequence and a living, breathing performance that actually breathes.</p></div>
        </div>
        
        <div class="row">
            <div class="sign"><h3>Leo</h3><p>The stage lights of the universe are flickering in your favor, even if you’re just performing for your DAW. Turn up the wet-dry mix on your confidence and let your lead melody ring out without constantly checking the peak meters.</p></div>
            <div class="sign"><h3>Virgo</h3><p>Perfectionism is acting like a harsh low-pass filter that’s cutting off your most interesting frequencies. Stop micro-editing the silence between the notes and embrace the organic hum of a tube amp left idling in a quiet room.</p></div>
        </div>
        
        <div class="row">
            <div class="sign"><h3>Libra</h3><p>Collaboration feels like a perfectly calibrated crossfader today, shifting smoothly between two distinct vibes. You’ll find the sweet spot between your vision and a partner’s input, resulting in a mix that feels much wider than the sum of its parts.</p></div>
            <div class="sign"><h3>Scorpio</h3><p>Dive into the sub-frequencies of your psyche where the dark, moody pads live. There is power in the sustain pedal today; hold onto a single creative thought until it evolves into something unrecognizable and hauntingly beautiful.</p></div>
        </div>
        
        <div class="row">
            <div class="sign"><h3>Sagittarius</h3><p>Your creative signal is traveling through a long chain of vintage outboard gear, picking up artifacts of inspiration along the way. Don't worry about the processing latency—the slight delay is where the actual groove is hidden.</p></div>
            <div class="sign"><h3>Capricorn</h3><p>You are the master clock today, keeping the entire session in sync despite the digital jitter of those around you. Lay down a foundation with such structural integrity that even the most chaotic modular jam couldn't shake the groove.</p></div>
        </div>
        
        <div class="row">
            <div class="sign"><h3>Aquarius</h3><p>With the sun in your sign, your circuit-bending ideas are finally starting to make sense to the mainstream. Patch a rhythm into an input it wasn't designed for and listen to what the ghosts in the machine are trying to tell you.</p></div>
            <div class="sign"><h3>Pisces</h3><p>The veil between the studio and the dreamworld is particularly thin, creating a natural chorus effect on your thoughts. Don't feel pressured to 'capture' the sound—just sit in the reverb tail and let the inspiration wash over you.</p></div>
        </div>
