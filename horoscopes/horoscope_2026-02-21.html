            <strong>MOON ALERT:</strong> The atmosphere is thick with tape hiss and dreamlike nostalgia; it's a day for capturing the vibe rather than chasing technical perfection.
        </div>
        
        <div class="grid">
            
        <div class="row">
            <div class="sign"><h3>Aries</h3><p>Your creative drive is hitting the red today, but be careful not to clip your master bus with impulsive decisions. Direct that high-voltage energy into a fast-paced sequence, and use a limiter on your temper during rehearsals.</p></div>
            <div class="sign"><h3>Taurus</h3><p>You're craving the tactile resistance of real mahogany and weighted keys today. Don't let a wandering LFO throw off your internal clock; stay grounded in your groove and trust the resonance of your lowest frequencies.</p></div>
        </div>
        
        <div class="row">
            <div class="sign"><h3>Gemini</h3><p>Your mind feels like a dual-oscillator patch where the pitch tracking is slightly off-kilter. Embrace the detuned, chorus-heavy nature of your thoughts, but wait until the morning to commit your final mix to the master recorder.</p></div>
            <div class="sign"><h3>Cancer</h3><p>Your internal preamp is running sensitive today, picking up every bit of ambient room noise. Close the studio door, dim the lights to a soft amber, and let the natural saturation of your emotions color your vocal takes.</p></div>
        </div>
        
        <div class="row">
            <div class="sign"><h3>Leo</h3><p>The stage lights are catching your faceplate just right, and your presence is adding a rich harmonic distortion to the room. Don't shy away from a long, expressive solo; the world is ready to hear your signature frequency at full volume.</p></div>
            <div class="sign"><h3>Virgo</h3><p>You might find yourself obsessing over micro-edits and phase alignment until the soul of the track starts to fade. Step away from the screen, let the analog imperfections breathe, and remember that some of the best hits were tracked on a whim.</p></div>
        </div>
        
        <div class="row">
            <div class="sign"><h3>Libra</h3><p>It is a perfect day for a collaborative session or fine-tuning your stereo imaging. Seek a balanced distribution of labor in your band, ensuring that no one is hogging the gain or burying the lead melody.</p></div>
            <div class="sign"><h3>Scorpio</h3><p>There is a haunting ghost in your signal chain today that wants to be explored. Dive deep into the sub-bass and the minor scales; the dark, cinematic textures you find in the shadows will be your most compelling work yet.</p></div>
        </div>
        
        <div class="row">
            <div class="sign"><h3>Sagittarius</h3><p>The itch for a new tour route or a radical genre shift is becoming impossible to ignore. Your creative compass is pointing toward unexplored sonic territories, so don't be afraid to patch something into an input it wasn't designed for.</p></div>
            <div class="sign"><h3>Capricorn</h3><p>You are the master clock for everyone around you today, providing the steady sync pulse they desperately need. Your disciplined approach to your craft is like a vintage console—reliable, expensive-sounding, and built to last a lifetime.</p></div>
        </div>
        
        <div class="row">
            <div class="sign"><h3>Aquarius</h3><p>Break the patch cables and start with a completely initialized preset. Your unconventional routing and love for glitchy, non-linear progression will lead to a breakthrough that leaves the traditionalists scratching their heads.</p></div>
            <div class="sign"><h3>Pisces</h3><p>With the Sun illuminating your sign, you are swimming in an ocean of infinite-decay reverb. Trust the melodies that come to you in the drift; your intuition is a high-fidelity transmission that doesn't require a manual to understand.</p></div>
