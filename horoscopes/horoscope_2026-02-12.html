            <strong>MOON ALERT:</strong> The Moon moves into a dreamy trine with Neptune, creating a lush, reverb-soaked atmosphere. It is a perfect day for deep sound design and loose jamming, but avoid signing any major label contracts after 4:00 PM when the signal might get fuzzy.
        </div>
        
        <div class="grid">
            
        <div class="row">
            <div class="sign"><h3>Aries</h3><p>Your transient response is peaking today, so channel that high-voltage energy into a punchy drum sequence. Just watch your gain staging—if you push the input too hard, you’ll clip the master before you even reach the chorus.</p></div>
            <div class="sign"><h3>Taurus</h3><p>It is a day for tactile satisfaction; step away from the mouse and spend quality time with your favorite analog hardware. The natural warmth of a tube preamp will provide the grounding your current project needs to feel finished.</p></div>
        </div>
        
        <div class="row">
            <div class="sign"><h3>Gemini</h3><p>Your creative signals are running in dual-mono today; try splitting your signal chain to explore two different sonic identities at once. Collaboration is your best plugin right now, as a second set of ears will help catch the phase issues you’ve been ignoring.</p></div>
            <div class="sign"><h3>Cancer</h3><p>The lunar vibes are hitting your fourth house of the home studio, making it the perfect time to layer some nostalgic, lo-fi pads. Keep the reverb tails long and let your emotions modulate the filter cutoff for a truly intimate, bedroom-pop take.</p></div>
        </div>
        
        <div class="row">
            <div class="sign"><h3>Leo</h3><p>The spotlight is hitting your oscillators, so don't be afraid to crank the mid-range and let your lead synth cut through the noise. Even if you're just practicing, perform like the house is sold out and your stage presence is being captured on vintage 16mm film.</p></div>
            <div class="sign"><h3>Virgo</h3><p>It is time for some surgical EQ on your daily routine; those muddy frequencies in your schedule are clouding your vision. Organize your sample folders and clean your patch cables today to ensure a lower noise floor for tomorrow’s session.</p></div>
        </div>
        
        <div class="row">
            <div class="sign"><h3>Libra</h3><p>Harmony is your primary oscillator today, so focus on finding the perfect balance between your melodic leads and the rhythmic foundation. A little sidechain compression in your personal life will help your creative goals breathe without being buried by chores.</p></div>
            <div class="sign"><h3>Scorpio</h3><p>Dive deep into the sub-harmonics of your psyche; there is a dark, compelling melody waiting in the lower octaves of your mind. Experiment with extreme bit-crushing or heavy distortion to reveal the hidden beauty within the digital artifacts of your process.</p></div>
        </div>
        
        <div class="row">
            <div class="sign"><h3>Sagittarius</h3><p>Your creative compass is pointing toward unquantized territory, so turn off the 'snap to grid' and let your rhythm swing naturally. It is a great day to sample field recordings from a place you’ve never been to add some organic texture to your rig.</p></div>
            <div class="sign"><h3>Capricorn</h3><p>Your workflow is locked to a rock-solid master clock today, making it the ideal time to finalize those tedious arrangement tweaks. Stay disciplined with your bounce-downs; the finish line for your project is much closer than the latency suggests.</p></div>
        </div>
        
        <div class="row">
            <div class="sign"><h3>Aquarius</h3><p>With the sun in your sign, you are encouraged to bypass the standard signal path and try something 'wrong' on purpose. Patch a feedback loop that shouldn’t work and find the accidental musicality in the resulting glitch and grit.</p></div>
            <div class="sign"><h3>Pisces</h3><p>You are swimming in a sea of granular clouds where reality and synthesis blur into a beautiful wash. Let your ideas drift without a fixed BPM today, focusing more on the atmospheric 'vibe' and less on the technical constraints of the DAW.</p></div>
        </div>
        
        </div>

        <div class="birthday">
            <strong>IF YOUR BIRTHDAY IS TODAY:</strong> You are entering a new cycle where your personal resonance finally matches the frequency of the universe. This year, expect your creative output to move from lo-fi sketches to a full-fidelity masterpiece as your internal clock finally syncs with your highest ambitions.
