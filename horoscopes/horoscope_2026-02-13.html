            <strong>MOON ALERT:</strong> The Moon in Capricorn creates a grounded, high-impedance atmosphere. It's a day for structural integrity—check your cable management and ensure your clock source is stable before you start tracking.
        </div>
        
        <div class="grid">
            
        <div class="row">
            <div class="sign"><h3>Aries</h3><p>Your internal oscillator is running hot today, which might lead to some unwanted clipping in your interpersonal mix. Back off the gain and channel that raw energy into a distorted lead synth line instead of a heated debate with a bandmate. One solid take is better than a dozen rushed demos.</p></div>
            <div class="sign"><h3>Taurus</h3><p>The planetary alignment offers a rich, analog warmth to your creative output. It’s the perfect time to invest in a piece of gear that will last a lifetime or finally calibrate your studio monitors. Trust your ears—if the low end feels right, don't over-process it into oblivion.</p></div>
        </div>
        
        <div class="row">
            <div class="sign"><h3>Gemini</h3><p>Mercury is introducing some digital jitter into your communications, so double-check your export settings before sending out stems. You’re feeling experimental, making it a great day for parallel processing or running your vocals through a weird chain of guitar pedals. Stay agile and don't get stuck in a sub-menu.</p></div>
            <div class="sign"><h3>Cancer</h3><p>Your emotional resonance is peaking, providing a lush 'wet' signal for any ambient or songwriting projects. If the DAW feels too cold, step away and capture some field recordings of your environment to ground your sound. Your intuition is your best filter today; trust what feels resonant.</p></div>
        </div>
        
        <div class="row">
            <div class="sign"><h3>Leo</h3><p>The sun is boosting your presence, making you the loudest signal in any room. Use this high-headroom energy to perform or pitch a new project, but be careful not to drown out the rest of the arrangement. Leave space for others to contribute their own textures to the mix.</p></div>
            <div class="sign"><h3>Virgo</h3><p>It’s a day for meticulous sample organization and deep-cleaning your keybeds. You'll likely find a forgotten loop that sparks a brand new track while you're tidying your digital workspace. Precision is your superpower right now—trust your surgical EQ cuts and your sense of timing.</p></div>
        </div>
        
        <div class="row">
            <div class="sign"><h3>Libra</h3><p>Balance is your primary objective, especially the ratio between your creative output and your rest cycles. A collaborative project may require some fine-tuning of the 'dry/wet' mix to ensure everyone's voice is heard. Your aesthetic eye is sharp, so spend some time on your visual branding or stage plot.</p></div>
            <div class="sign"><h3>Scorpio</h3><p>You are exploring the sub-harmonics of your psyche today, looking for the deep, heavy tones. Don't be afraid to get a little 'dark' with your sound design; that’s where the most authentic grit lives. Just remember to de-esser your thoughts before you speak them aloud.</p></div>
        </div>
        
        <div class="row">
            <div class="sign"><h3>Sagittarius</h3><p>Your creative vision is wide-open, but you might be neglecting the necessary gain staging to get there. Focus on the signal path of your career and make sure you aren't skipping steps in your quest for the 'big sound.' An unexpected invitation to a jam session could break a long-standing creative block.</p></div>
            <div class="sign"><h3>Capricorn</h3><p>With the Moon in your sign, you are the master clock for everyone around you. It’s a highly productive day for finishing arrangements and finally hitting 'export' on that long-term project. Trust the foundation you've built; your 'analog' soul is more reliable than any plugin.</p></div>
        </div>
        
        <div class="row">
            <div class="sign"><h3>Aquarius</h3><p>It's your season, and your frequency response is broader than ever. Expect some 'happy accidents' while patching your modular or writing lyrics that feel like they're coming from another dimension. You are the innovator today, so don't let traditional music theory limit your modulation.</p></div>
            <div class="sign"><h3>Pisces</h3><p>You’re drifting in a beautiful sea of delay repeats and tape saturation. It’s a dream-like day for songwriting, where the melodies seem to emerge from the noise floor without effort. Keep a recorder handy, as these ethereal ideas might vanish once the sun goes down.</p></div>
        </div>

        <div class="birthday">
            <strong>IF YOUR BIRTHDAY IS TODAY:</strong> Happy birthday! This year, your life is receiving a massive firmware update. Expect an increase in your creative headroom and a shift toward more authentic, analog-style connections. Remember to save your progress often and don't be afraid to turn up the saturation on your dreams.
