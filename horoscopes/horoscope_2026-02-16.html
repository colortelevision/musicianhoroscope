            <strong>MOON ALERT:</strong> The Moon in Aquarius creates a high-voltage atmosphere perfect for experimental patching. It’s a 'no-input mixing' kind of day—let the feedback loops find their own frequency and don't be afraid of a little digital jitter.
        </div>
        
        <div class="grid">
            
        <div class="row">
            <div class="sign"><h3>Aries</h3><p>Mars is pushing your internal BPM into gabber territory, but watch your headroom before you commit to tape. You’re ready to drop the lead single, just make sure you haven’t accidentally clipped the master fader in your rush to cross the finish line.</p></div>
            <div class="sign"><h3>Taurus</h3><p>Venus is warming up your signal chain like a vintage tube preamp, bringing a lush thickness to your creative output. It’s a solid day to invest in that boutique wood-paneled synth, provided you actually have room for it in the studio rack.</p></div>
        </div>
        
        <div class="row">
            <div class="sign"><h3>Gemini</h3><p>Your musical ideas are bouncing around like a multi-tap delay with the feedback set to 99%. Try to commit one solid melody to the arrangement before the buffer overflows and the inspiration vanishes into the ether.</p></div>
            <div class="sign"><h3>Cancer</h3><p>You’re feeling as sensitive as a vintage ribbon microphone today—handle your interactions with care and avoid 'phantom power' personalities. Retreat into your home studio and find solace in some long-tail ambient reverbs and soft felt piano textures.</p></div>
        </div>
        
        <div class="row">
            <div class="sign"><h3>Leo</h3><p>The cosmic spotlight is hitting you like a 1000-watt stage lamp, so make sure your stage plot is finalized and your cables are wrapped. Collaboration is your path to a hit today, as long as you don't turn yourself up too loud in the monitor mix.</p></div>
            <div class="sign"><h3>Virgo</h3><p>It’s a deep-cleaning day for your project folders; finally rename those tracks from 'Audio_01' to something actually useful. Organize your sample library and troubleshoot that persistent ground hum that’s been ghosting your best takes.</p></div>
        </div>
        
        <div class="row">
            <div class="sign"><h3>Libra</h3><p>Harmony is your default setting, but today you might find a strange beauty in microtonal dissonance. Experiment with unconventional scale tunings or a bit of 'happy accident' bit-crushing on your favorite poly-synth patches.</p></div>
            <div class="sign"><h3>Scorpio</h3><p>Your creative process is shrouded in mystery and heavy sidechain compression today. Dive deep into the sub-frequencies of your latest track, but don't get so lost in the sonic basement that you forget to check how the mix translates in mono.</p></div>
        </div>
        
        <div class="row">
            <div class="sign"><h3>Sagittarius</h3><p>Your musical horizons are expanding like an ultra-wide stereo field. It’s a perfect day to plan a DIY tour or explore a genre you usually claim to hate—there’s a secret inspiration hidden in that forgotten patch cable.</p></div>
            <div class="sign"><h3>Capricorn</h3><p>Your workflow is as steady as a master MIDI clock, ensuring every beat hits exactly where it should. While you’re building the structural foundation of your next EP, remember to let a little analog drift into the oscillators for some human character.</p></div>
        </div>
        
        <div class="row">
            <div class="sign"><h3>Aquarius</h3><p>With the Sun highlighting your sign, you’re the boutique modular system of the zodiac: unpredictable, complex, and totally unique. Embrace your weirdest sonic impulses today, as the world is finally ready to hear your experimental B-sides.</p></div>
            <div class="sign"><h3>Pisces</h3><p>The veil is thin and the dry/wet knob is turned all the way to 'Wet.' You’re channeling melodies directly from the astral plane, so keep a field recorder nearby to capture the ghosts in the machine before they fade away.</p></div>

            <strong>IF YOUR BIRTHDAY IS TODAY:</strong> You are a classic piece of analog gear—sometimes temperamental and hard to calibrate, but impossible to replicate. This year, your career reaches a sweet saturation point where the grit of your experience and the clarity of your vision finally align for a perfect master.
